# Anomaly Detection in Voice Conversations
IEEE publication link : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=Anomaly%20detection%20Akilandeswari

Anomaly detection in voice conversations involve detection of unusual patterns,
behavioral patterns and voice noise, anomaly points using statistical methods in an audio that
is conversation between multiple speakers. It is a critical aspect of ensuring the reliability,
security, and quality of communication systems. This project presents a comprehensive
approach to detecting anomalies in voice conversations using advanced signal processing
techniques and machine learning algorithms. Leveraging features such as Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, and energy, the system
extracts relevant information from audio data to characterize normal and abnormal speech
patterns
